My configuration and customization of -- https://toms3d.org/2017/02/23/building-cheapest-possible-prusa-i3-mk2/


* ramps-1.4 -- original ramps-based system
* mks-gen-1.4 -- a system based on mks gen using 24V power supply.

Both configurations are set to use M8 rods with 1.25mm pitch instead of
M5 rods with 0.8mm pitch

Z build volume is limited to 180mm.
